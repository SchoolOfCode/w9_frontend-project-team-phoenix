TEAM PHOENIX
# Frontend Brief
Create a frontend app that will improve the lives of boot campers.

# What problem does our app solve?

We asked ourselves the following 3 questions:

- What can help them with the vast amount of learning there is to do as a new developer?
- What do they need?
- What problem might they have that your application could solve for them?

Create a minimum viable product (MVP) showcasing an innovative full stack application which meets the user need youâ€™ve identified

# Features 

Our project application included the following:


- User experience created in React
- Built and managed in an agile way
- Utilised testing for ensuring robust code
- Pulldown button to select week
- Feedback form
- FAQ page
